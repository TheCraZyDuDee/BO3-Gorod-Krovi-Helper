# BO3-Gorod-Krovi-Helper

## Due to the tool being AI-generated and my current focus on learning coding, I'll no longer be maintaining or providing support for this tool.

__A Webversion of this Tool can now be found [here](https://thecrazydudee.github.io/Gorod-Helper-WebTool/) (Still WIP)__

Tool which tries to help with various steps in the Gorod Krovi Easter Egg.<br>
Currently only help for the Bomb and Valve step are included.
