# BO3-Gorod-Krovi-Helper

Ever got annoyed by the Bomb Minigame Step for the Gorod Krovi EE?<br>
This Tool helps to remember the Bomb locations by just clicking them in the GUI in order.<br>
__UPDATED: Users can now get all possible Valve Combinations for the Pink Cylinder step from the tool__

Maybe in the future i think about adding more features to it but for now it is what it is.
